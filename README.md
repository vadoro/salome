# Character as a Web of Words: Towards a Network Theory of Narrative

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the research paper "Character as a Web of Words: Towards a Network Theory of Narrative". This repository contains the relevant materials and the published paper. 

## Overview

This study explores an integration of network science and structuralist narratology to advance the analysis of literary characters, moving beyond the conventional methodology that simplistically categorizes characters as mere nodes within a social network. By drawing upon Seymour Chatman's narrative theory, particularly his view of character as “a paradigm of traits,” I conceptualize characters as networks of words that manifest a constellation of traits. This approach enables a sophisticated examination of character interactions as complex (mis)encounters of words and traits, rather than simple social relationships. 

This interdisciplinary method broadens the analytical scope beyond mere social interactions, and enhances our understanding of the multifaceted nature of characters and their dynamics in literature. My paper concludes by suggesting that networked understanding of character as a web of words can pave the way for “a unified theory of plot and style,” a significant breakthrough in literary studies as envisioned by Moretti. Building a comprehensive network theory of narrative, I argue, is a significant work that will refine the digital literary studies and revive the structuralist narrative theories.
